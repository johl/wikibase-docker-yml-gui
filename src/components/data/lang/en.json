You can get more informations <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)\">here</a>.</p><p>If you want to setup docker now you can use <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/\">this link</a>.</p><p>Also you will need Docker-Composer, which is included in the Docker community edition, so most likely you won't need to install it separately. You can find Docker-Composer <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\">here</a>.</p><p>You can run the whole setup or use directly the default settings:</p>",
